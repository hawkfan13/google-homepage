Goolge Homepage

For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For some of you, this may be the first time you’ve actually tried to “build” something in HTML (very exciting!).

Using the browser’s developer tools (right-clicking something on the page and clicking “inspect element” will get you there) will be your best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out.

The biggest challenge for me here was just getting started to be honest, I feel I have a good understanding of HTML and CSS but doing it on my own with no supervision was the challenge here.

Not only that but finding an area to start was challenging as well, I found it constructive to assemble the webpage in blocks rather than scattering around.

I will probably come back and update this depending on how the rest of thr course goes for me.
